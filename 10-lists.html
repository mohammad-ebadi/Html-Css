    <h1>Description Lists</h1>
    <dl>
        <dd>solid</dd>
            <dt>Matter with a fixed shape and volume. The particles are closely packed and vibrate in place, making solids rigid. Examples include ice, wood, and metal.</dt><br>
        <dd>liquid</dd>
            <dt>Matter that has a fixed volume but takes the shape of its container. The particles are less tightly packed than in solids, allowing them to flow. Examples include water, oil, and milk.</dt><br>
        <dd>gas</dd>
            <dt>Matter that has neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume. Gas particles are spread out and move freely, filling whatever space is available. Examples include oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.</dt><br>
        <dd>plasma</dd>
            <dt>A high-energy state where gas particles become ionized (charged) due to extreme heat or electromagnetic forces. Examples include lightning and the Sun's surface.</dt>
