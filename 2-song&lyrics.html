    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>[Chorus]
        I feel like I'm losing my mind (Mind)
        Is everybody in the world blind? (Blind)
        Please, Lord, give me a sign, a sign (A sign, a sign)
        I feel like I'm losing my mind (Mind)
        Is everybody in the world blind? (Blind)
        Please, Lord, give me a sign, a sign (A sign, a sign)
        
        [Verse 1]
        I wanna be the greatest, everybody on their fake shit
        I look around and feel like everybody is the fakest
        I make this, everyday and I'm impatient
        Hoping one day I blow up from the basement
        Statement, the top is so vacant
        I don't hear shit that I think is amazing
        Waiting, for my day when I'm playing
        Sold out shows for a thousand faces
        Ay, give me that crown (Ay)
        Get in my way and you'll be put down
        It ain't your place no this my town
        If I want that shit, then I'll get it right now (Now)
        I'm losing it, the noose, it fits, some lucid shit, a stupid myth
        You choose to live or choose to dip
        You choose to fight or lose your grip and lose a gift, aw (Now)
        
        [Chorus]
        I feel like I'm losing my mind (Mind)
        Is everybody in the world blind? (Blind)
        Please, Lord, give me a sign, a sign (A sign, a sign)
        I feel like I'm losing my mind (Mind)
        Is everybody in the world blind? (Blind)
        Please, Lord, give me a sign, a sign (A sign, a sign)</pre>
